This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, and your rights regarding that information. We've written this in plain English so it's easy to understand.

**OurFable is designed for parents and legal guardians.** Only adults (18+) may create accounts and use our service. By using OurFable, you represent that you are the parent or legal guardian of any child whose photos you upload.

## How AI Processing Works

OurFable uses artificial intelligence to generate personalized storybook illustrations featuring your child. Here's how it works:

1. You upload photos of your child
2. Photos are securely transmitted to our AI processing service (Replicate)
3. AI generates custom illustrations based on the photos
4. Generated illustrations are used in your personalized storybook
5. Original photos and AI-generated images are stored temporarily to fulfill your order

**Important details:**
- Your child's photos are processed by Replicate, a third-party AI service provider
- Replicate processes photos solely for generating your storybook — they do not retain, sell, or use photos for any other purpose
- We have a data processing agreement with Replicate that prohibits them from using your photos beyond our instructions
- AI-generated illustrations may not perfectly replicate your child's appearance — they are artistic interpretations
