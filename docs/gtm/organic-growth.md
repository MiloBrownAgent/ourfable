# OurFable.ai — Organic Growth Strategy

## Social Media Strategy

### Instagram (@ourfable.ai)

**Posting cadence:** 5x/week (3 Reels, 1 carousel, 1 story series)

**Content pillars:**
1. **Kid Reactions (40%)** — The hero content. Kids seeing themselves in animated storybooks for the first time. These will be the most shared/saved posts.
2. **Creation Process (25%)** — Screen recordings showing how fast and easy it is. "Watch us turn one photo into an animated storybook in 3 minutes."
3. **Parent Moments (20%)** — Bedtime reading the book, gifting it, emotional parent reactions.
4. **Behind the Scenes (15%)** — How the AI works (simplified), team stories, product updates.

**Content ideas:**
- "This is what happens when a 4-year-old sees herself as a princess in an animated book" (Reel)
- Side-by-side: uploaded photo → animated character (carousel)
- "3 minutes. 1 photo. Pure magic." (time-lapse Reel of creation process)
- Bedtime routine featuring the animated book on a tablet
- "We asked 10 kids what they thought of their books" (compilation Reel)
- Parent reading book aloud with kid on lap — showing animated pages
- "The gift that made grandma cry" (gifting angle)

**Hashtag strategy:**
- Primary: #OurFable #PersonalizedStorybook #AnimatedStorybook
- Discovery: #PersonalizedGiftsForKids #KidsBooks #ToddlerActivities #MomLife #DadLife #BedtimeStories #GiftsForKids
- Trending: Participate in relevant parenting trends

### TikTok (@ourfable)

**Posting cadence:** 7x/week (short-form video, 15-60 seconds)

**Strategy:** TikTok is about volume and virality. Post more, test fast, double down on what works.

**Content ideas:**
- "POV: Your kid finds out they're the main character" (reaction video)
- "Things that make mom cry" trend with book reveal
- "Is this the future of bedtime stories?" (AI + kids angle)
- "Best gift under $15 for kids" (gift guide format)
- "I made my kid a book in 3 minutes and this happened..."
- Duet/stitch with other parenting creators
- "Things I wish existed when I was a kid" trend

**Key:** Always show the ANIMATION. Static screenshots of a digital book won't perform. The movement is the hook.

### Facebook

**Strategy:** Community-first, not broadcast. Facebook is where parents actually discuss and recommend products.

**Actions:**
1. **Create an OurFable Facebook Group** — "OurFable Families" where parents share their kids' books and reactions
2. **Page posting:** 3x/week, focus on shareable content (kid reactions, gift ideas)
3. **Community participation:** Actively (but authentically) participate in parenting groups

**Target Facebook Groups for organic seeding:**
- Moms Who Think (1M+ members)
- Motherhood Unfiltered (500K+ members)
- Toddler Activities & Learning (300K+ members)
- Gift Ideas for Kids (various, 50-200K members)
- Homeschool / Montessori groups (product fits educational angle)
- Local mom groups (start with your city/region)

**Rules for group participation:**
- Never spam. Be a helpful community member first.
- Share product only when someone asks for gift ideas or personalized book recommendations
- Have 3-5 real parents (early customers) who genuinely love the product share organically
- Follow each group's rules — many ban direct promotion but allow recommendations in relevant threads

---

### Reddit Strategy

**Target subreddits:**
- r/parenting (5.5M members)
- r/daddit (1M+ members)
- r/Mommit (800K+ members)
- r/beyondthebump (600K+ members)
- r/toddlers (200K+ members)
- r/NewParents (150K+ members)
- r/giftideas (when relevant threads appear)

**Approach:**
- Build karma in these subs by being genuinely helpful for 2-4 weeks before any mention of the product
- When someone asks "unique gift for my toddler?" or "personalized book recommendations?" — share OurFable naturally
- Do one "I built this" post in r/SideProject or r/EntrepreneurRideAlong — these communities love founder stories
- Never astroturf. Reddit will destroy you if they smell fake engagement.

## Referral & Share Mechanics

### Built-in Virality

Every completed book should have:

1. **Share Preview:** A 10-15 second animated preview that can be shared to social (auto-generated, branded but not obnoxious)
2. **Share Button:** One-tap share to Instagram Stories, Facebook, iMessage, WhatsApp
3. **Referral Code:** Every customer gets a unique code. Share it, both people get $5 off.
4. **Gift Flow:** "Make a book for someone else's kid" — requires only the child's name and photo. Generates a gift link.

### Referral Program Details

| Action | Reward |
|---|---|
| Share referral link | Referrer gets $5 credit, friend gets $5 off first book |
| Share book preview to social | Enters monthly drawing for free hardcover |
| Leave a review + photo/video | Gets 20% off next book |
| Refer 5+ friends who purchase | Free hardcover of any book |

**Viral loop target:** Each customer refers 0.3-0.5 new customers (industry benchmark for viral consumer products).

### "Gift-a-Book" Feature (Priority Build)

Grandparents are the #2 buyer segment. Make it dead simple:
- ourfable.ai/gift → Enter child's name → Upload photo (or request photo from parent) → Pay $14.99 → Animated book delivered to parent's email
- This flow should be optimized for people who are NOT tech-savvy (grandparents)
- Consider: "Request a photo" flow where grandparent enters parent's email, parent gets a link to upload the photo, book is auto-generated

### Birthday Automation

- Day of: "Happy Birthday [Child]! 🎂 Here's 20% off a birthday-themed book"

### Segmentation
- **Parents** (primary purchasers) — product updates, new themes, parenting content
- **Grandparents** (gift buyers) — gift flow, holiday reminders, "make it easy" messaging
- **Gift buyers** (other) — seasonal reminders, occasion-based triggers
