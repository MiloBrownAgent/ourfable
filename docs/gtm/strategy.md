# OurFable.ai — Go-To-Market Strategy

## Executive Summary

OurFable is an AI-powered animated digital storybook that transforms a single photo into a personalized 12-page animated experience in under 3 minutes. At $14.99 digital-only, it sits at an impulse-buy price point with massive gifting potential. The animated differentiator (Ken Burns illustrations, page-turn animations, ambient particles) separates us from every competitor in the personalized kids book space — none of them offer animation.

**Core positioning:** "The only personalized storybook that comes alive."
