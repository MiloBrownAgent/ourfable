FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

OurFable Launches the First Animated Personalized Storybook for Kids
Upload one photo, receive a 12-page animated digital storybook in under 3 minutes

[CITY, STATE] — [DATE] — OurFable (ourfable.ai) today launched the first animated 
personalized storybook experience for children ages 2-10. Parents upload a single 
photo of their child, and OurFable's AI creates a fully personalized, animated 
12-page digital storybook in under three minutes — complete with Ken Burns-style 
moving illustrations, page-turn animations, and ambient particle effects.

"Every child deserves to be the hero of their own story — and to see that story 
come alive," said [Founder Name], founder of OurFable. "We've taken personalized 
children's books from static pages to a living, breathing animated experience that 
kids ask to watch again and again."

Unlike traditional personalized books from companies like Wonderbly or Hooray Heroes, 
which require days or weeks for physical delivery, OurFable delivers an animated 
digital experience instantly. At $14.99, it's positioned as an accessible gift for 
birthdays, holidays, or any day a child needs a little magic.

KEY FEATURES:
• One photo upload → personalized animated storybook in under 3 minutes
• 12 pages of original illustrated content featuring the child as the main character
• Ken Burns-style animation, page-turn effects, and ambient particles
• Viewable on any device — phone, tablet, or computer
• $14.99 per book (hardcover print option coming soon)

OurFable is available now at ourfable.ai.

## PR Outreach Best Practices

1. **Personalize every pitch.** Reference a specific article they wrote. "I loved your piece on [X] — OurFable touches on the same theme of [Y]."
2. **Lead with the visual.** Include a 30-second demo video or GIF in every pitch email.
3. **Make it easy.** Offer to create a free personalized book for the editor/their child.
4. **Follow up once.** 5-7 days after initial pitch. Then stop.
5. **Build a media kit page.** Host at ourfable.ai/press with downloadable assets, demo video, founder bio, and key facts.
6. **Product Hunt launch.** Coordinate a launch day with upvote support from waitlist/community. Best days: Tuesday-Thursday.
