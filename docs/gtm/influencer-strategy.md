# OurFable.ai — Influencer Strategy

## Approach

Focus on nano (1K-10K) and micro (10K-100K) influencers. They deliver 2-5x higher engagement rates than macro influencers and feel authentic to their audience. Parenting is a trust-based vertical — a real mom showing her kid's reaction to the book is worth more than a celebrity endorsement.

**Why NOT mega influencers:**
- $5K-50K per post, terrible ROI at our price point
- Lower engagement rates (1-2% vs 3-8% for nano/micro)
- Audience doesn't trust sponsored content as much
- One post and done — no relationship building

## Influencer Tiers & Budget

| Tier | Followers | Compensation | Expected Posts | Budget/Creator |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nano | 1K-10K | Free product + affiliate code (15% commission) | 1 feed + 2-3 stories | $0 upfront |
| Micro | 10K-50K | Free product + $100-250 flat fee + affiliate | 1 reel + 3 stories | $100-250 |
| Mid | 50K-200K | Free product + $500-1,000 flat fee + affiliate | 1 reel + 1 feed + stories | $500-1,000 |

**Phase 2 budget:** 10 nano ($0) + 5 micro ($750) = ~$750/month
**Phase 3 budget:** 10 nano ($0) + 8 micro ($1,500) + 3 mid ($2,250) = ~$3,750/month

## Outreach Approach

### Step 1: Warm Up (1 week before outreach)
- Follow the influencer
- Genuinely engage with 3-5 of their posts (meaningful comments, not "love this!")
- Share one of their posts to OurFable stories if relevant

### Step 2: DM Outreach

**Template (Nano):**
> Hi [Name]! 👋 I'm [Dave/Name] from OurFable — we make animated storybooks where kids become the main character. I've been following your content and love how you [specific reference to their content].
>
> I'd love to make a free personalized book for [child's name] — all I need is one photo and it creates a 12-page animated storybook in about 3 minutes. No strings attached — if you love it and want to share with your followers, amazing. If not, your kiddo still gets a cool book! 😊
>
> Would you be interested?

**Template (Micro/Mid):**
> Hi [Name]! I'm [Dave/Name], founder of OurFable.ai. We've built something I think your audience would genuinely love — an animated personalized storybook for kids. Upload one photo and in 3 minutes, your child is the star of their own animated story (page-turn animations, moving illustrations, the works).
>
> I'd love to:
> 1. Create a free book for [child's name] so you can experience it firsthand
> 2. Discuss a potential collaboration — we're offering [free product + $X fee + 15% affiliate commission]
>
> Your engagement with your community is exactly the kind of authentic voice we want to partner with. Would love to chat — happy to jump on a quick call or keep it in DMs, whatever works!

### Step 3: Follow Up
- If no response in 5 days, one follow-up DM
- If still no response, move on — never send more than 2 messages
- For email outreach (if DM doesn't work), keep it to 3 sentences max
