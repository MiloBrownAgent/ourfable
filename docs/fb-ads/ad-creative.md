## Creative Production Notes

- **Minimum viable creative:** Static images with mockups of the storybook on a device. Can be made in Canva or Figma in a few hours.
- **Ideal creative:** Screen-recorded GIF/video of an actual OurFable storybook showing the animations. Even 5–10 seconds of the Ken Burns effect + page turn would outperform static.
- **UGC angle (future):** If any beta users share reactions, that's gold for ads. Kid-reacting-to-their-book videos would crush.
- **Do NOT use:** Stock photos of random kids (feels inauthentic), heavy text overlays (Meta penalizes), misleading before/after.
